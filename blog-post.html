    <h1>Customer Churn Prediction: Analyzing and Predicting Customer Attrition</h1>

    <p>
        Welcome to our in-depth exploration of customer churn prediction! In the following sections, we'll guide you through the crucial steps of building a predictive model to identify customers at risk of leaving.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Preprocessing, Exploration, and Visualization</h2>

    <p>
        Before diving into model building, it's essential to preprocess the data to ensure it's in a suitable format. This includes handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features. Let's explore the data and create visualizations to understand its characteristics.
    </p>

    <pre>
        <code>
            # Handle missing values
            data_clean <- na.omit(data)

            # Encode categorical variables
            data_encoded <- model.matrix(~., data_clean)

            # Explore data distribution
            hist(data_clean$age, main="Age Distribution", xlab="Age")

            # Visualize correlation matrix
            corr_matrix <- cor(data_clean)
            image(corr_matrix, main="Correlation Matrix", col=bluered(100))
        </code>
    </pre>

    <h2>Logistic Regression Model Building</h2>

    <p>
        With the data prepared, it's time to build the logistic regression model. We'll split the data into training and testing sets, train the model, and evaluate its performance.
    </p>

    <pre>
        <code>
            # Split the data into training and testing sets
            set.seed(123)
            split_index <- createDataPartition(data_clean$churn, p = 0.8, list = FALSE)
            train_data <- data_clean[split_index, ]
            test_data <- data_clean[-split_index, ]

            # Build logistic regression model
            logistic_model <- glm(churn ~ ., data = train_data, family = "binomial")

            # Make predictions on the test set
            predictions <- predict(logistic_model, newdata = test_data, type = "response")
        </code>
    </pre>

    <h2>Model Evaluation and Interpretation</h2>

    <p>
        Evaluating the model's performance is crucial. We'll use metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and the ROC curve. Additionally, we'll interpret the coefficients to understand the impact of each variable on the prediction.
    </p>

    <pre>
        <code>
            # Evaluate model performance
            confusion_matrix <- table(test_data$churn, predictions > 0.5)
            accuracy <- sum(diag(confusion_matrix)) / sum(confusion_matrix)
            precision <- confusion_matrix[2, 2] / sum(confusion_matrix[, 2])
            recall <- confusion_matrix[2, 2] / sum(confusion_matrix[2, ])
        </code>
    </pre>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>

    <p>
        In conclusion, building a customer churn prediction model involves several key steps, from data preprocessing to model evaluation. Logistic regression provides a solid framework for binary classification tasks, and interpreting the results allows businesses to make informed decisions about customer retention strategies.
    </p>

    <h2>Next Steps</h2>

    <p>
        The journey doesn't end here. To enhance the model further, consider experimenting with feature engineering, trying different algorithms, or exploring more advanced techniques like ensemble learning. Continuous monitoring and updates to the model will ensure its relevance and effectiveness in predicting customer churn.
